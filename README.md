This repo is a documentation to show what a Requirements Analysis document is and how it plays a key role in the SDLC.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It is one of the most crucial phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation upon which the entire system is designed and built.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering – Collecting input from stakeholders (clients, users, business analysts, managers, etc.) through interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and observation.
2. Requirement Categorization – Dividing requirements into functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (performance, security, usability, etc.).
3. Feasibility Study – Checking whether the requirements are technically, economically, and legally feasible.
4. Requirement Prioritization – Ranking requirements based on importance, cost, and urgency.
5. Requirement Documentation – Preparing clear and structured documents such as the Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
6. Requirement Validation – Ensuring that the requirements are consistent, complete, realistic, and align with business goals.

### Types of Requirements
- Functional Requirements – Define specific functions or behaviors (e.g., “The system must allow users to log in with email and password”).
- Non-Functional Requirements – Define quality attributes (e.g., performance, reliability, scalability, and security).
- Domain Requirements – Industry-specific needs and rules (e.g., compliance requirements in healthcare or finance).

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Clarity of Scope – Prevents misunderstandings by ensuring all stakeholders have a common understanding of the system.
2. Prevents Rework – Early identification of needs reduces costly changes later in development.
3. Guides Design & Development – Provides a blueprint for system architecture, coding, and testing.
4. Improves Quality – Clear requirements ensure the final product meets user expectations and business objectives.
5. Enhances Communication – Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and developers by translating business needs into technical terms.
6. Facilitates Testing – Test cases are designed based on documented requirements, ensuring complete coverage.
7. Risk Reduction – Identifies potential issues, constraints, or conflicts at an early stage.

This repo is a documentation to show what a Requirements Analysis document is and how it plays a key role in the SDLC.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It is one of the most crucial phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation upon which the entire system is designed and built.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
* Requirement Gathering – Collecting input from stakeholders (clients, users, business analysts, managers, etc.) through interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and observation.
* Requirement Elicitation – Clarifying and uncovering hidden requirements using techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, and workshops.
* Requirement Documentation – Preparing structured records such as the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) to capture functional and non-functional needs.
* Requirement Analysis and Modeling – Examining requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness, often using diagrams and models like UML or DFDs.
* Requirement Validation – Ensuring requirements are correct, complete, realistic, and aligned with business goals through reviews, walkthroughs, and prototypes.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements  
Functional requirements define what the system should do. They describe the specific features, services, and interactions that the system must provide to meet user and business needs.

**Examples for Booking Management Project:**  
- User registration and login for customers and hotel managers  
- Search functionality for hotels based on location, price, ratings, or availability  
- Hotel managers adding, updating, or removing hotel listings  
- Customers booking hotels with real-time availability checking  
- Secure payment processing using third-party payment gateways  
- Viewing and managing past and upcoming bookings  
- Sending booking confirmation and cancellation notifications to users and managers  

### Non-functional Requirements  
Non-functional requirements define how the system should perform rather than what it should do. They set the quality standards, constraints, and performance benchmarks for the system.

**Examples for Booking Management Project:**  
- High scalability to handle thousands of users and bookings simultaneously  
- Fast response time (search and booking results should load within 2–3 seconds)  
- 99.9% system uptime to ensure continuous availability  
- Data security with encryption for user information and payments  
- Mobile responsiveness for seamless use on phones, tablets, and desktops  
- Integration with CDN for faster content delivery worldwide  
- Logging, monitoring, and error handling for system reliability

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Clarity of Scope – Prevents misunderstandings by ensuring all stakeholders have a common understanding of the system.
2. Prevents Rework – Early identification of needs reduces costly changes later in development.
3. Guides Design & Development – Provides a blueprint for system architecture, coding, and testing.
4. Improves Quality – Clear requirements ensure the final product meets user expectations and business objectives.
5. Enhances Communication – Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and developers by translating business needs into technical terms.
6. Facilitates Testing – Test cases are designed based on documented requirements, ensuring complete coverage.
7. Risk Reduction – Identifies potential issues, constraints, or conflicts at an early stage.
